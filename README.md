JGUIME
===========

Back on 2007, JGUIME was a library to build a user interface on cell phones
supported by J2ME. Today it is a library to interface some facilities with
Android and Java 1.5.

It carries some of my personal tastes about development and my feellings about
Exception handling in Java (I hate them).

Today all code especially built to J2ME was removed. Only the interface with
Java 1.5 and Android remains.

This library is still under development.
